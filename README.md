# Jedi

 A fault tolerant (well what is the harm in calling it one), decentralized platform to express the fundamental human right i.e. Free Speech . 

# Architecture

 Here is a rough architecture of our platfrom that we whipped up using Microsoft Paint. Yeah we professionals.
 This project was  designed in a way to keep the ipfs implementation part isolated from the core application itself. Firstly, we were not so well versed in ipfs to begin with and thought lets keep it for the later part
 (traits of a pro coder team).

# Why even build this / About this project ?

Yes, a very valid question you all should ask.
Well, my college had this one project as an academic requirement...
Our team had other plans , but then that would be kinda really hard to finish in the given time frame with all the other academic and non - academic work we had gotten ourselves into . 

Yes , this project is open source but has been fundamentally buit by us three folks :-

1) Arun Mathai (arunmathaisk.in)
2) Soham Kulkarni
3) Komal Chitnis
